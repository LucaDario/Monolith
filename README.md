# Premises
Monolith is the project that our team, the NPE Developers, has chosen to realize during the project that had to be done as part of the Software Engineering course which is part of the Bachelor Degree in Computer Science at the Universitiy of Padua, during the 2017/18 academic year.

# Monolith
Monolith is an interactive bubble provider that works with every [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/)-based projects, and lets the developer use and create interactive bubbles to do whatever he likes. 

## Installation
The SDK has also been deployed to [Atmosphere](https://atmospherejs.com) and can be found at the following link: [npedevelopers:monolith](https://atmospherejs.com/npedevelopers/monolith).
To install it, just open a prompt command inside the root folder of your Meteor project, and type the following commads:
```
> meteor add npedevelopers:monolith
> meteor reset
> meteor npm start
```

**Note**. This procedure will erase all of your temporary saved project's data, but is necessary in order to make Meteor work properly.

# About Rocket.chat
If you plan to use Monolith inside a [Rocket.chat](https://rocket.chat)-based project, note that we developed also a Rocket.chat-compatible version of Monolith, which can be used instead of this one. 
All information on how to install it can be found here: [Monolith-rc](https://github.com/NPE-Developers/Monolith-rc).
To know how to use that version, please instead see below.
